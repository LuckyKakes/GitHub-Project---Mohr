#### Project 1: Balloon
  This was a simple assignment where we had to create an image using shapes for one of the themes (I chose balloons). 

#### Project 2: Banana Crab
  This assignment taught me how to use images off the internet or a local drive in a p5.js project. I designed it so that the crabs will move when the mouse/banana     moves. They move in a way that looks like they are reaching for the banana (they like bananas).

#### Project 3: Meteor
  This was an assignment where we had to use 3 functions from a p5.js library to create something. The library I chose was p5.animS. My sketch is supposed to       
  represent a meteor and a planet. I used two animated lines: one to create the meteor and one to create the trail of the meteor. Then, I animated a circle for the    planet.
